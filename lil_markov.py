# TODO: Use some kind of lyrics api instead of already existing .txt files

# TODO: choose artist?
# TODO: have it cut off only at the end of a line, otherwise it ends awkwardly on random words
#		actually should probably just choose number of lines instead of words, keep track of \n's
# TODO: Maybe not be able to start on a key with a newline. sometimes you end up with the first line
#		only being one or two words

# TODO: starting word function is currently case sensitive
# TODO: adlibs (in parentheses) should be treated as one word

# possible user flow:
# 1. enter artist as command line arg
# 2. ask how many lines they want
# 3. output lines
# 4. ask if they want to continue, if yes goto 2, if no exit
